# siriTask

I create Siri Shortcut in Swift using NSUserActivity. 
With "Add New Bill" command siri will open the app and displays a page that enables the user to add a new bill (random number).


1. Using isEligibleForSearch & isEligibleForPrediction We will be able to see our activity under Siri Suggestions.
2. By adding our shortcut as new shortcut. This means it will be launched by simply using Siri voice.
