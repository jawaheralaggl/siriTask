# siriTask

I create Siri Shortcut in Swift using NSUserActivity. 
With "Add New Bill" command siri will open the app and displays a page that enables the user to add a new bill (random number).


1. Using isEligibleForSearch & isEligibleForPrediction We will be able to see our activity under Siri Suggestions.
2. By adding our shortcut as a Siri voice shortcut. This means our shortcut will be launched by simply using Siri voice.
