# siriTask

I create Siri Shortcut in Swift using NSUserActivity. 
Wiht "Add New Bill" command siri will open the app that is show a page with random number.


1. Using isEligibleForSearch & isEligibleForPrediction We will be able to see our activity under Siri Suggestions.
2. By adding our shortcut as a Siri voice shortcut. This means our shortcut will be launched by simply using Siri voice.
